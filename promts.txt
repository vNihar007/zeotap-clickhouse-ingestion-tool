1. “Generate a Docker Compose file to launch ClickHouse with JWT authentication enabled.”  
2. “Write a shell script that accepts `--host`, `--port`, `--user`, and `--token` arguments and validates the ClickHouse connection.”  
3. “Create a Node.js utility to inspect a CSV header and auto‑generate a ClickHouse table schema.”  
4. “Implement batch insertion of CSV rows into ClickHouse using the official Node.js client.”  
5. “Develop an Express.js route to fetch and return the list of tables from a ClickHouse database.”  
6. “Write middleware for Express that injects the JWT token into all ClickHouse client requests.”  
7. “Draft a Python function using `clickhouse-connect` to stream query results into a CSV file.”  
8. “Show how to map CSV data types (e.g., INT, FLOAT, DATE) to ClickHouse column definitions in SQL.”  
9. “Implement retry logic with exponential backoff in Node.js for transient network errors during ingestion.”  
10. “Write a pytest that spins up a Dockerized ClickHouse instance and verifies row counts after ingestion.”  
11. “Outline a Prometheus exporter in Node.js exposing metrics: `ingestion_total`, `ingestion_errors`, and `rows_processed`.”  
12. “Provide a README snippet explaining setup steps for the ingestion tool, including environment variables and JWT configuration.”  
13. “Generate HTML/CSS for a two‑tab UI: one for ‘ClickHouse → CSV’ and one for ‘CSV → ClickHouse’.”  
14. “Design a React form with inputs for Host, Port, Database, User, and JWT Token for ClickHouse.”  
15. “Create a React file‑upload component that accepts a CSV and lets the user specify a delimiter.”  
16. “Implement a dropdown toggle in React to switch between ingestion modes (‘ClickHouse→CSV’ vs. ‘CSV→ClickHouse’).”  
17. “Write an Express.js route `/api/source-csv/ingest` using Multer to handle CSV uploads.”  
18. “Configure Multer middleware in Express for parsing multipart form data on `/api/source-csv/ingest`.”  
19. “Demonstrate how to connect to ClickHouse with JWT authentication using a Node.js or Java client.”  
20. “Implement an Express.js endpoint `/api/info/tables` that queries ClickHouse for its table list and returns JSON.”  
21. “Add an Express.js endpoint `/api/info/tables/:table` to fetch and return column names for a specified ClickHouse table.”  
22. “Write an Express.js route `/api/export/:table` that streams ClickHouse query results back as a CSV file.”  
23. “Implement React checkboxes populated from `/api/info/tables/:table` so users can select which columns to ingest.”  
24. “Add a React progress‑bar component that updates based on ingestion progress events from `/api/source-csv/ingest`.”  
25. “Draft Express error‑handling middleware to catch and return user‑friendly messages for connection or auth failures.”
